These assignments are done as part of computer architecture course, under Prof. Anshul kumar
##Lab1 
#Stage-1 :
Write a function for comparing two strings. Comparison in case-sensitive as well as
case-insensitive modes should be supported.
Result: whether the first string is less than or equal to or greater than the second string

#Stage-2 : 
Using the function of stage 1, write a function to merge two sorted lists of strings,
maintaining the sorting order
Result: (i) pointer to the merged list and (ii) size of the merged list 

#Stage-3 :
Using the functions of stages 1 and 2, write a recursive merge-sort function.
Result: (i) pointer to the sorted list and (ii) size of the sorted list

##Lab2
